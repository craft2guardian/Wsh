# Wsh

Fast and lightweight command-line shell written in C++ for Windows.
Not to be confused with Windows Script Host.

This is my first project in C++, so any help or suggestions are very welcome!

## Current Features


clear – clears the console

cd – change directory

whoami – prints the current user

run – runs a .exe file

pwd – prints the current directory

ls – lists files in the current directory

## Notes

This project is very early, so most things may not function as intended.

Expect Windows console quirks (Quick Edit mode, title changes, etc.)

Feedback and contributions are welcome!
