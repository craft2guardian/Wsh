# Wsh
Fast and light command line shell written in C++ for windows. Not to be confused with Windows Script Host (currently in early prototype)

This is my first project in C++ so any help/suggestions would be appreciated!


Current features:

clear

cd

whoami

run (runs a exe)

pwd (prints current directory)

ls



This project is very early and most things will probably not function as intended
